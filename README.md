# FPGA-Based-Implementation-of-Convolutional-Autoencoder
This project implements a 22-layer convolutional autoencoder on the Intel DE1-SoC FPGA using a hardware-software co-design approach. The Keras model is quantized using full integer quantization (INT8) and deployed with Verilog-based MAC units and embedded C for real-time image reconstruction.
